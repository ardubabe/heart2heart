Hey! I’m Ardubabe 👾

I present to you: Heart 2 Heart! ✨ A DIY customisable conversation tool for all your hot dates, whether romantic 💋 or platonic 👯 

I created this project and tutorial with the aim to get you inspired by creative computing (and to show off your sexy cyber skills on dates of course 🥵) 

The illusion that coding is boring, dry, difficult and only for men is a LIE!!! 😠 Engineering can be sexy, fun, soft, creative, and ACCESSIBLE to everyone, especially femmes and thems! 🎉

Ok, but WHAT is the tool?! HOW do I use it?!
 
Well, the idea is that when you make this tool, you input all the burning questions you have for your date 😏 and assign different LED colours to indicate the question type (eg. raunchy, trivial, philosophical) Then, on the date, you take turns to press the button, revealing one of your questions at random. But really, you can adapt it to do whatever you like!! I don’t care!! I’m merely giving you the tools to go off and do what you wish 🧚🏻 

So... what are you waiting for!! Here is the tutorial website: https://heart2heart.cargo.site/  

I have written instructions with accompanying video tutorials to try and make it as accessible as possible to all learning styles. It’s not perfect!! So, if you have any feedback please leave some on the feedback link or you can DM me on Instagram @ardubabe 🤝 

GOOD LUCK!!! AND ENJOY!!!! 💅🏻
